## Overview

### The Challenge

This is a list of requirements for a web development assignment that involves creating a responsive library website using Tailwind and JavaScript:

-  The website should be responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS.
-  JavaScript should be used to handle the logic and conditional rendering using DOM, as well as creating a list.
-  A code formatter such as Prettier and ESlint should be included in the project.
-  An advanced assignment includes using a JavaScript framework and implementing CI/CD.

## My process

### Built with

-  HTML5
-  CSS
-  Javascript
-  Tailwind CSS
-  Prettier
- ParcelJS
- ReactJS

### What I learned

- Tailwind gives a lot of flexibility: Tailwind makes it easy to create a responsive website. I can easily change the size of the elements, the color, the font, and the spacing. This also makee Tailwind more flexible and easier to change in the future.
- Easy customization:  Tailwind CSS offers a huge array of classes that allow for easy customization of website design without writing much CSS code. It imposes limitations that make designs more coherent and consistent. This flexibility and design system make Tailwind a preferable alternative to Bootstrap.
### Continued development

-  I'd like to improve responsiveness of the website.
